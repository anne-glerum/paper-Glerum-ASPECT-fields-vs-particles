The python plottings scripts were created with python 3.9.7
and the specific environment specified in the file requirements.txt.
We advised to install the same python libraries through

pip3.9 install -r ../requirements.txt 

or when the installation process suggests it

pip3.9 install -r ../requirements.txt  --user

Then plots can be created with

python3.9 stress_plots.py
